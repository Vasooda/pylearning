#tuple --- lists that cannot be modified -- immutable once you create it its the way it is you can't sort it or replace

#advantages -- it makes this easier and efficient, makes code more predictable, its safe because it can't be easily changed -- faster than lists -- if you don't need a list to change that a great oppurtunity to use tuple

#a tuple can be used as a key in dictionaries

my_tuple = (1,2,3,4,5)

#print(my_tuple[2])
#print(5 in my_tuple)
#print(new_tuple)

new_tuple = my_tuple[1:2]

x,y,z, *other = (1,2,3,4,5)
print(x)

print(my_tuple.count(5)) #count
print(my_tuple.index(4)) #index
print(len(my_tuple)) #length
