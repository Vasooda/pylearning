#for iterating over iterable objects for loops are great

#if your not sure how you many times you want to loop or how long it will take for looping -- while something is true keep looping

#example
while True:
  response = input('say something: ')
  if (response == 'bye'):
    break

#break breaks out of the current conditiona loop

#continue means go to the top of the loop again until the loop ends

#pass doesn nothing -- it passes to the next line -- rarely used -- its a good way to have a placeholder to fill something for the loop -
